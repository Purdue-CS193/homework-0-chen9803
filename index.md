# Aidan Chen's First CS193 Homework

### My favorite things about CS193:
- Getting instruction from other students is nice because I can ask them about their experiences
- I should learn how to use terminal more 
- I don't have to spend money on a textbook or iClicker
- I don't have to study for any exams
- Everyone is from the Bay Area
